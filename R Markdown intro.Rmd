## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


Note: if you're using Rstudio - it's installed. If you're not using rstudio, "Insert a new R chunck", install.packages("rmarkdown").

```{r}
install.packages("rmarkdown")
library(rmarkdown) #to load the dataset
```

Some examples:
```{r}
vector <- c(1:3)

print(vector)
```

change to {r, echo = FALSE} so that the code is not shown in your output document
```{r, echo=FALSE}
vector <- c(1:3)

print(vector)
```

another way to do the same
```{r, include=FALSE}
vector <- c(1:3)
```

and later on shown the selected result
```{r}
print(vector)
```

List of languages supported by R Markdown
```{r}
names(knitr::knit_engines$get())
```

Notice that i.e. bash won't work under Windows because it is not installed

Python shall work
Warning: The 'python' engine in knitr requires the reticulate package. If you do not want to use the reticulate package, set the chunk option python.reticulate = FALSE.
Error in loadNamespace(name) : there is no package called ‘reticulate’
```{python, python.reticulate = FALSE}
x = 42 * 2
print("python", x) 
```
