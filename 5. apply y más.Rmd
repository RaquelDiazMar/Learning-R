When working with R, it is advisable to use APPLY instead of FOR loops.
```{r}
?WorldPhones # The number of telephones in various regions of the world (in thousands).
data("WorldPhones")
```

Using a FOR loop:
```{r}
for(aCountry in 1:ncol(WorldPhones)) {
  print(mean(WorldPhones[aCountry, ]))
}
```
```{r}
for(Year in 1:nrow(WorldPhones)) {
  print(mean(WorldPhones[, Year]))
}
```

Using APPLY instead:
```{r}
?apply # Returns a vector or array or list of values obtained by applying a function to margins of an array or matrix.
apply(WorldPhones,1,mean)
```

```{r}
apply(WorldPhones,2,mean)
```


```{r}
?apropos # returns a character vector giving the names of objects in the search list matching (as a regular expression) what.
apropos(".apply")
```
```{r}
?find #returns where objects of a given name can be found.
find("apply")
```

LAPPLY - para listas
```{r}
?lapply # returns a list of the same length as X, each element of which is the result of applying FUN to the corresponding element of X.
?list # Functions to construct, coerce and check for both kinds of R lists.
world.phone.list <- list(WorldPhones) #coerces the dataframe into a list
lapply(world.phone.list,function(x) {x>10000}) # for each value in WorldPhones, asks whether it is greater than 10,000
```

TAPPLY
```{r}
?tapply #Apply a function to each cell of a ragged array, that is to each (non-empty) group of values given by a unique combination of the levels of certain factors.
```

SAPPLY - para vectores
```{r}
?sapply #is a user-friendly version and wrapper of lapply by default returning a vector, matrix or, if simplify = "array", an array if appropriate, by applying simplify2array(). sapply(x, f, simplify = FALSE, USE.NAMES = FALSE) is the same as lapply(x, f).
```


END
```{r}
rm(list=ls())
```
